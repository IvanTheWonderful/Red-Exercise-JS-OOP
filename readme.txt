## Defination of 4 pilars of OOP JS

### Encapsulation
means hiding information and show limited info.

### Inharitance
Just like mother can have several children who look similar to mother,
the child class have same properties of the parent class.

### Polymorphism
Just like a chemical element can be in multiple forms, 
classes can do the same.

### Abstraction
This is to ensure simplicity of the code.
We need to absctract similar concept away.
